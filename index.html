	<h2>What is this?</h2>
	<p class="cols-2">
		This is just a small project to visualize follower relationships on <a href="http://micro.blog" />Micro.blog</a>.  I started it when I realized that I wanted to discover more users and wanted a concise way to start seeing some of the relationships between users.  I didn't want anything fancy, but at least something that let me quickly scan user followers and their follower networks.  Since Micro.blog has a <a href="http://help.micro.blog/2017/api-json/">public API</a>, I figured I'd throw something together.
	</p>

	<h2>Usage</h2>
	<p class="cols-2">
		I could probably get away with using my own token, but I figure I'd rather not expose it and risk any trouble.  You'll need to get your own.  Fortunately, if you have a Micro.blog account, you can generate one very easily on the <a href="https://micro.blog/account/apps">accounts page</a>.  Think up a witty name and click that "Generate Token" button to get your own.  Then just copy the value and paste it into the "token" field below.  From there, consider which user you'd like to start with and put his or her username into the "user" field.  Then click "start" and you'll see a list of all followers.  That list includes the user, which is kind of weird, but there's no data cleanup at the moment.  From there, just click on another user's information and the followers for that user will appear in the next column.

	<h4>Disable CORS</h4>

	<p class="cols-2">
		You'll also need to disable CORS in your browser.  CORS is a technology to avoid cross-site scripting attacks by limiting whether requests are allowed by their origin.  This is usually by-passed by querying a trusted service,
		but this is a web page with no backing server.  You'll need to just configure the browser to ignore this security restriction.  <a href="https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2014/08/bypass-cors-errors-testing-apis-locally/">Instructions for Chrome, Firefox, and Safari</a>
		are available online (note that you may need <a href="https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/chrome/9nHBcjNW384"></a>some additional setup on Chrome</a> than what's documented in the previously linked article).
